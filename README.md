**Infographics** As I complete projects or as the inspirations strikes me I create infographics with useful or interesting information

*ChartColors* This chart contains suggestions for color schemes (and their hexadecimal values) that might be useful and aesthetically appealing.  I intend to incorporate this into a larger infographic about how to make charts more generally.  Most of the colors were chosen from an online tool available at http://paletton.com/.

**projects_DataScience** This is the main repository for data science projects I've worked on in my spare time.  These include projects from kaggle and other projects that I have taken an interest in.  For each project There should be 4 major components:
 
1. An untouched repository of raw data.
2. A jupyter notebook with python code.
3. A report, usually a .pdf file written in LaTeX.
4. A presentation, usually also a .pdf file.  

*windEnergy_Prediction_CAISO* This was my final project for a data science class I took at General Assembly.  I predict how much electricity will be produced from wind farms connected to a particular electrical grid in California over the next hour.

**textbook_DataScienceAlgorithms** I've taken to writing down my notes about data science in a more-or-less rigorous format.  Each chapter started as notes about that particular algorithm, I refine the notes, fill in some explanatory information and maybe some examples and then add the notes as a chapter to this book.
